🚦 Smart Traffic & Parking Management System
AI-Powered Adaptive Traffic Control & Parking Intelligence for Smart Cities

📌 Problem Statement
Urban areas face increasing traffic congestion, inefficient fixed-time signals, and illegal roadside parking. Traditional traffic systems lack real-time monitoring and adaptive decision-making, leading to longer waiting times, fuel wastage, and higher emissions.

This project introduces an AI-powered Smart Traffic & Parking Management System that uses computer vision and real-time analytics to optimize traffic signals and manage parking violations efficiently.

🎯 Objective

Detects vehicles in real time
Calculates lane-wise traffic density
Dynamically adjusts traffic signal timings
Detects illegal roadside parking
Improves traffic flow and road safety
